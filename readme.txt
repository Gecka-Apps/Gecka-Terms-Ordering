Order your categories, tags or any other taxonomy's terms of your Wordpress website.

== Description ==

Have you ever wanted to sort your categories using drag and drop? Have you ever used a plugin that implements some sort of custom taxonomy or custom categories but no drag and drop sorting support?

Then, that plugin is for you. Using it you can enable categories custom ordering using drag and drop. But not only, you can set it to enable custom ordering of any other taxonomy's terms, even taxonomies created by other plugins.

By default, drag and drop sorting is enabled for your posts categories. If you want to order any other taxonomy, go read <a href="http://gecka-apps.com/wordpress-plugins/terms-ordering/">the plugin's page on our website</a>.
